# MC-QuestSytem
Minecraft plugin for a quest system, currently W.I.P
How it should work
-Admin makes a quest with command
-Gets an item, the item gets an ID
-Admin creates an NPC, it gets and ID
-Admin gives the NPC the quest
-When players right click the NPC, they get a random quest, once every X time
